# Pygame-Space-Invaders-Project

This is a mini-game project developed using Python and the Pygame library, inspired by the classic arcade game "Space Invaders". This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in game development with Pygame and is one of my first projects as a beginner in Python programming.

## Features

- Classic Space Invaders gameplay
- Starting countdown
- Player-controlled spaceship that can shoot, move left and right
- Enemies that move and shoot randomly
- Health bar mechanic
- Only 1 Level currently
- Simple pixel art graphics and sound effects
- Guiding comments in Turkish on main.py for those who are new to pygame.
